### What is the Infusing Computing webseries?

Welcome to episode one of the Infusing Computing webseries.

In these episodes we will share guidance from our NSF-funded research program which focuses on embedding computational thinking into middle school and high school classrooms.

The webseries will include four types of episodes:

Infusing Computational Thinking: This is a deep dive into what is computational thinking (CT), and how to embed it in instruction.
Water Cooler: This is a behind the scenes look at the project as we share news, notes, and insight for project participants.
Focus On The Content Area: This is a look at connecting with CT from a disciplinary perspective.
Report From The Field: This is a talk with a classroom teacher that is currently trying to embed CT in their classroom.
All episodes are meant to be quick (under 10 minutes) and to the point.

In this first episode, we talk with one of our project leaders, Dr. Jennifer Albert.
